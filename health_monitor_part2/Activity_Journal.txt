C Health Monitoring System Project - Part 2

Name: Gideon Wikina

===========  Stage 1  ==========================================
Start
Estimated Time	01 30
Plan:
(Order of implementation, testing approach, estimation technique)
I can first introduce this by adding addPatient and then go to the main feature 
in health.c Checking will be achieved by trying to verify the patient's 
ID and print it out to make sure they fit.

Complete
Actual Time	00 45
Observations:
(Lessons learned, problems encountered, obstacles overcome, etc.)
The longest part of this process was to find out what the systems really stood 
for, and how to use them properly. 
It was pretty easy having worked out how to use the constructs to work out the 
rest.
