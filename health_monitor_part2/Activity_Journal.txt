C Health Monitoring System Project - Part 2

Name: Gideon Wikina

===========  Stage 1  ==========================================
Start
Estimated Time	01 30
Plan:
(Order of implementation, testing approach, estimation technique)
I can first introduce this by adding addPatient and then go to the main feature 
in health.c Checking will be achieved by trying to verify the patient's 
ID and print it out to make sure they fit.

Actual Time	00 45
Observations:
(Lessons learned, problems encountered, obstacles overcome, etc.)
The longest part of this process was to find out what the systems really stood 
for, and how to use them properly. 
It was pretty easy having worked out how to use the constructs to work out the 
rest.
===========  Stage 2  ==========================================
Start
Estimated Time	01 30
Plan:
(Order of implementation, testing approach, estimation technique)
I expect to implement most of the functions in health util, and then incorporate 
what needs to happen in part two of the main function. 
My research methodology will be close to Part 1 I will enter the code given in 
the Part 2 examples, and then add the printed statements

It wasn't terrible to upgrade the key function, it was just calling a one function. 
The most time consuming items were implementing 3 of the utility functions. 
I then wrote A while loop to print out each buffer and its nexts each time it 
was called This was only to test that all was correctly linking


===========  Stage 3  ==========================================
Start
Estimated Time	00 15
Plan:
(Order of implementation, testing approach, estimation technique)
I assume I had correctly introduced my system from the very beginning to keep
working with multiple input lines and to be able to store more than one patient
at a time. 
I'm going to check with a simple while loop that prints patients out.

Actual Time	00 05
Observations:
(Lessons learned, problems encountered, obstacles overcome, etc.)
My code worked perfectly with what should have been done at this point. 
The five minutes included writing a print statement and ensuring it was 
correctly connected together.
