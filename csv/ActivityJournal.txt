SWEN-250 Activity Reflection

Name: Gideon Wikina

================================================================
Implement code to pass all unit tests

Estimated Time	02 30
Plan:
1) get_field
- define variables: end = '\0', nchar = 0; i = 0
- while not at the end of the field, the field array will be assigned the char
value at that index
- define cases that may define the end and assign  that char value to 
the variable end 
- return end casted as an int
2) get_line
- define variables: line as a csv_line, line.nfields = 0; fieds = get_field(line.field[line.nfields])
- return line depending on the cases defined the fields 

3) print csv 
- while loop to print out components of the field
Complete
Actual Time	03 00
Observations:
(Lessons learned, problems encountered, obstacles overcome, etc.)
- Test 7, 8, 9, 10 failed as it was not accounting for some fields and 
"control reaches end of non void function
- Added return statement at the end of get_line and 7, 9, 10   
failed 
- replaced if statement with a switch case and everything was good, I assume 
that I was not accounting for the comma case.
