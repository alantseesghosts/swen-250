SWEN-250 Activity Reflection

Name:

================================================================
Start Part 1
Estimated Time	72 30
Plan:
- Define variables fahrenheit & celcius as integers 
- print out a title 
- utilize a for loop that goes from 0 to 300, incrementing i by 20 
- assign i to fahrenheit 
-define celsius equation using fahrenheit 
- return celsius 

Complete
Actual Time	06 00
Observations:
(Lessons learned, problems encountered, obstacles overcome, etc.)

- I learned that the c syntax does not handle fraction like (5/9) as it the 
integer it rounds to zero, i had to rewrite the equation using by multplying by
5 and dividing by 9. 

- spacing was off so i added an if/else statement to reduce a space after i gets
to 100

-  needed %d to print integer


================================================================
Start Part 2
Estimated Time	24 00
Plan:
- copy the chart1.c 
- change ints to floats 
- return 0 instead of celsius 

Complete
Actual Time	01 00
Observations:
(Lessons learned, problems encountered, obstacles overcome, etc.)
- needed to change d% to %f
- to round to the nearest tenth I needed to add a .1 infront of the f
