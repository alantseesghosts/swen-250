================================================================
Start Part 1
Estimated Time	01 00
Plan:
- Define variables for index and characters as ints
- add each character in the line to the array 
- if chracter is a new line assign that value at that index as a newline and 
then increment the index

Complete
Actual Time	00 30
Compile Attempts: 1
Compile errors: 0
Observations:
(Lessons learned, problems encountered, obstacles overcome, etc.)

- Hardest obstacle was attempting to figure out how to overcome the newLine.
Eventually figured it out by using a conditional and incvreasing the index 
as soon as that eneter key return value is found. 


================================================================
Start Part 2
Estimated Time	01 00
Plan:
- implement copy function
- create a variable to store the max length and an array to store the maxlines
-conditional if current length is greater than max length, then then current 
length becomes the max length. Then this line is copied.
- print out line after EOF this entered

Complete
Actual Time	00 45
Compile Attempts: 3 
Comile Errors: 2
Observations:
(Lessons learned, problems encountered, obstacles overcome, etc.)
- Biggest obstacle was understanding the main function. Was unsure how to go 
about it. I guess I didn't really understand the relation to copy function as 
it takes in two separate arrays. After, I was made aware that I needed to
create a second array, the process made more sense.
- a couple of spelling errors made my program unable to compile.
