C Health Monitoring System Project - Part 1

===========  Stage 1  ==========================================
Start 
Estimated Time 01 00
Plan:
(Order of implementation, testing approach, estimation technique)
My plan is to implement the code the way that I think it will work at first
I will try to test this code, and then go back and fix any issues and 
fix any gramatical things in the print statement if needed.  I will test by using
sample input from various paragraphs in the project write up.  
I chose this amount of time because parsing a single line of code and printing it
isn't the hardest function to write.

Actual Time	06 00
Observations:
(Lessons learned, problems encountered, obstacles overcome, etc.)

Not gonna lie, I realized that parsing through this kind of input was more 
difficult than I thought.After having a lot of problems with getchar(), 
decided to use scanf().This was also more difficult to use as I had never used 
it before, lots of google needed to try to figure out how to use scanf properly.

===========  Stage 2  ==========================================
Start
Estimated Time	02 30
Plan:
(Order of implementation, testing approach, estimation technique)
My plan of implementation is to try to add the new features that are needed.
Testing will be using the examples that were given to us and seeing if my code
matches the output.

(Lessons learned, problems encountered, obstacles overcome, etc.)
A major problem I had was however copying over an array, my indexes were off 
and it was causing many problems.


===========  Stage 3  ==========================================
Start
Estimated Time	03 00
Plan:
(Order of implementation, testing approach, estimation technique)
For testing I will use the example input and compare it with the sample output
I chose this amount of time because I tend to be getting faster and understanding 
the concepts more, and I feel like I know where this stage is going.

Observations:
(Lessons learned, problems encountered, obstacles overcome, etc.)
At first, I tried to use if statements. I realized that using switch statememnts
were better for this scenario. 


===========  Stage 4  ==========================================
Start
Estimated Time	02 00
Plan:
(Order of implementation, testing approach, estimation technique)
My plan is to work on the code bit by bit and see if what i did works
If not change the approach, if it does, keep going forward
I will make very large test files to check to see my overflow works properly
Complete
Actual Time	03 00
Observations:
(Lessons learned, problems encountered, obstacles overcome, etc.)
There were really no problems with this section
It was adding a few if statements while it's collecting data. My biggest issue
was fatigue from this project as a whole.


===========  Stage 5  ==========================================
Start
Estimated Time	01 30
Plan:
(Order of implementation, testing approach, estimation technique)
I think that my code already works with this stage because I set it to already 
end at EOF
testing will be done with the first example of input in the project write up
I chose this amount of time because it should be simple.
Complete
Actual Time	02 00
Observations:
(Lessons learned, problems encountered, obstacles overcome, etc.)
A lot of errors that I had to go fix, still have a lot of warnings, but it 
works well.
