Implement these functions in the order below.

Your name: Gideon Wikina

================================================================
create_node
Start
Estimated Time	01 00
Plan:
(Order of implementation, testing approach, etc.)
I tried to follow the steps one at a time as the top of the function 
comments required. Also, looking at lecture slides multiple times was a necessity.
Tested at the end of completing the function.

Complete
Actual Time: 00 40
Observations:
(Lessons learned, problems encountered, obstacles overcome, etc.)

No real problems with this function. Took me a little time to actually 
understand what the problem wanting to do. Slowing down and taking the problem, 
piece by piece was very helpful.

================================================================
add_node_at_head
Start
Estimated Time	00 30
Plan:
(Order of implementation, testing approach, etc.)

follow the steps and hints carefully, test at the end of completing the 
function.

Complete
Actual Time	00 45
Observations:
(Lessons learned, problems encountered, obstacles overcome, etc.)

Was missing the cases where the function would return 0.

Forgot to initialize the initial node_val to a integer.


================================================================

Start
Estimated Time	HH MM
Plan:
